# 🧾 Week 1 Report – Cybersecurity Monk Mode (July 25–31)

## 📌Theme
Linux + Terminal Basics via Bandit (OverTheWire)

## ✅ Bandit Progress
Completed Levels: 0 - 16  
Tools Used: WSL2, Ubuntu, PowerShell, SSH, GitHub  

## 🧠 Commands Learned
- `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `clear`
- `touch`, `nano`, `cat`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`
- `whoami`, `sudo`, `adduser`, `chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp`
- `cut`, `sort`, `uniq`, `wc`, `grep`, `find`, `which`, `history`, `|`
- `gzip`, `gunzip`, `bzip2`, `bunzip2`, `xz`, `unxz`, `tar`
- `base64`, `strings`, `tr`, `xxd`
- `ssh`, `telnet`, `nc`, `openssl s_client`, `nmap`

## 📒 Key Learnings
- How to navigate Linux using only the terminal (no GUI)
- SSH login via password and private keys
- Understanding ports, services, and basic network scanning
- Using redirection and piping to manipulate outputs
- Importance of journaling and organizing cyber notes
## 🔥 Favorite Commands
- `nmap` – useful for scanning open ports and detecting services
- `grep` – powerful for filtering output
- `nano` – now feels familiar as a basic terminal editor
- `strings` - It helps in filtering human readable language from machine language.

## ❌ Mistakes / Confusions
- File permission errors while using SSH private key
- Forgetting to use `chmod 600` for private key files
- Trying to use `touch` in PowerShell before learning it's a Linux-only command

## 💡 Insights
- Consistent daily practice compounds fast
- Man pages (`man ls`) are gold for understanding command flags
- Linux builds real hacker thinking — starting to enjoy the CLI more than GUI!

## 🧠 Reflection Prompts
- What surprised me most? → I actually enjoy terminal work!
- One thing I’d teach someone? → How to SSH into a server using a key
- Goal for next week? → Polish Linux fluency and start working with Git + GitHub confidently

## Linux Commands Learned Today

- **dig (Domain Information Groper)** - It is a flexible DNS lookup tool that is part of the BIND DNS suite.   
Common flags include `+short`, `+noall +answer`, `@server`. Here server can be replaced by a dns server address.  
	**Ex-** `@8.8.8.8 (google)`
- **nslookup** - Older DNS query tool that shows A record, authoritative name servers, and mail servers. It is faster then dig but less detailed.
- **host** - It quickly displays IP address of a domain server and reverse DNS.
- **traceroute** - Shows the path your packet takes through routers to reach a domain/IP. Its flags includs-
	+ -n - do not resolve hostnames (faster)
	+ -m - max hops (e.g. -m 20)
	+ -w - wait time for each hop (e.g. -w 1)

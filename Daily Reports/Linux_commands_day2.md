## Things That Amazed Me

It was very surprising to know that everything we have whether its linux commands, hard disks, virtual disks or even our devices that we can mount in our system. IT'S ALL A FILE!!!
Literally everything is a file and since its a file we can even delete, edit, modify or change it. Although its quite a hard task to do as everything written in these files are in binary language.

## Most Useful Command I Found Today

**find** â€“ Itâ€™s an extremely helpful command that can locate files by name, type, size, or ownership. Just a small command, and it finds exactly what you're looking for â€” making it incredibly powerful for cybersecurity, scripting, and system administration.
